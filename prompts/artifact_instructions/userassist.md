GUI-driven program execution via Explorer shell, per user.
- Shows what users launched interactively — useful for distinguishing user actions from automated/service execution.
- Suspicious: rarely used or newly appearing applications, script hosts and LOLBins launched from Explorer, tools from atypical folders.
- Key fields: run count and last execution time together show behavioral changes.
- Limited scope: only captures Explorer-launched programs, not command-line or service execution.
